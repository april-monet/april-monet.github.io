GitHub Pages Website for Prog109

This is a basic HTML5, CSS, and JS website created for Programming 109 class (Fall, 2019).
Pages have been created per specifications given for assignments. CSS styling reflects some of my own design choices, though limited to using elements introduced in class (therefore no flexbox, responsive design, or LESS/SASS.). No servers were used, so all JavaScript is client side.
