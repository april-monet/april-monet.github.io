      Welcome to my recipe website, where I share some of the desserts I have
      made this year that I considered a success worth sharing! This is also
      serving as a way to keep recipes that I want to make again, in case I lose
      the "hard copy" or someone asks me for a copy of a recipe.
      <p>
        I find cooking to be an art form similar to drawing and music, since one
        must master tools and techniques, emulate masters, and practice a lot
        before composing one's own variation or original work. There is the
        additional benefit, however, that one can eat this art form, and
        experience it through the sense of taste and smell as well as its visual
        aesthetics. Like music, it is temporal: existing in space and time until
        it is eaten up and only the memories and the recipe remain, until -like
        a performance- it is made again some other time. Dessert in particular
        is artistic because it is not necessary for survival, but is utterly
        delightful and enriches life with something out of the ordinary. Dessert
        allows me to delight in the details, apply my perfectionism in a
        positive way, and thrill in tackling the challenges of new recipes.

        I have been experimenting a lot lately with cheesecakes, ever since I
        got an Instant Pot pressure cooker that makes moist baking easy as pie.
        The cheesecake is a form that allows one to create many different
        possible flavors and toppings, simply by adding to the base with a bit
        of knowledge and skill. I am currently preparing to make several holiday
        flavor themed cheesecakes for an upcoming fundraiser for my choir. You
        will find the titles and descriptions on the Cheesecake page, though I
        have only put up the recipes for a few of them so far. Once I have
        actually made all of them and taken decent pictures of the result, I
        plan to update this section so it will be more complete. There are
        currently some very nice photos taken by others (with proper attribution
        of course) standing in until I can create my own to show what the recipe
        should actually look like.
      </p>

        In the "Other Desserts" category you will find another pressure cooker
        recipe, this time for that timeless French classic, Créme Brûlée. There
        is also a recipe for flourless chocolate cake, which I made for my last
        birthday. I hope to add on to this soon as well, to include recipes for
        some items such as Tiramisú, Chocolate Eclairs (I have to master that
        Choux pastry first though...), and other desserts that are neither
        cookies nor cheesecakes. The "Cookies and Bars"category is still a work
        in progress, and I hope to update it soon as well. Eventually, once I've
        made more cakes and pies, that category of dessert may get its own page.

        I am also considering adding a page for beverages, since I have recently
        started making my own Chai Masala, I enjoy making mulled cider and wine
        for the holidays, and I'm going to try my own Egg Nog this year as well
        (I also plan to put some in a cheesecake...I'll let you know how that
        turns out).
