        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Cake:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>1/2 cup (8 Tbl.) unsalted butter</li>
          <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
          <aside class="aside">
            * Espresso enhances chocolate's flavor as much as vanilla does.
            Using 1 tsp. will simply enhance the flavor, while 2 tsp. will lend
            a hint of mocha to the cake.
          </aside>
          <li>
            1 - 2 tsp. instant espresso (such as Starbucks Via Italian Roast)*
          </li>
          <li>1 tsp. Vanilla extract</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ganache Glaze:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Vanilla Mascarpone Whipped Cream (optional):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
          <li>4 oz. Mascarpone</li>
          <li>1 tsp. Vanilla extract</li>
          <li>Granulated sugar to taste (1 Tbl. or more)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Berry Sauce (optional):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 or all of a 16 oz. package of frozen mixed berries</li>

          <li>1 cup of water</li>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        Cake:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 375F. Lightly grease an 8-inch round cake pan; cut a
            piece of parchment to fit, lay it in the bottom of the pan, and
            grease it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt chocolate chips and butter in a double-boiler over medium-low
            heat, then transfer to a mixing bowl.
          </li>
          <li>Stir in the sugar, salt, instant espresso, and vanilla.</li>
          <aside class="aside">
            ** An alternate way to mix the cocoa powder to prevent clumps is to
            add the liquids to the cocoa, a bit at a time, whisking into a paste
            that then becomes more liquid as the rest is added.
          </aside>
          <li>
            Add the eggs, beating briefly until smooth. Add the cocoa powder,
            and mix just to combine.**
          </li>
          <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
          <li>
            Bake the cake for 25 minutes; the top will have formed a thin crust,
            and it should reach an internal temperature of 200F.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove cake from oven and set on a wire rack (in pan) to cool for 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loosen the edges of the cake from the pan and turn it out onto a
            serving plate. Allow to cool completely before glazing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Glaze:
        <ol>
          <li>
            To make the glaze, warm the cream in the double-boiler until hot but
            not simmering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the chocolate and stir until melted and combined smoothly with
            the cream.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the glaze over the cake starting at the center and then
            circling outward, until it drips down the sides slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow glaze to cool and set for several hours before serving. May be
            refrigerated for up to a week, covered, once glaze is cool.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Optional toppings:***
        <aside class="aside">
          *** These are highly recommended for their complementary flavors,
          which lighten the intensity and richness of the cake.
        </aside>
        <p>Vanilla Mascarpone Whipped Cream:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Chill mixing bowl and beaters in freezer until frosty.</li>
          <li>
            Combine heavy cream, Mascarpone, vanilla, and sugar in chilled bown
            and beat with stand mixer on medium until soft peaks form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Test for sweetness and add more sugar if desired. Continue beating
            on medium-high until stiff peaks form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Refrigerate until ready to use. Top individual slices of cake with a
            substantial spoonful or two, and drizzle with berry sauce.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Berry Sauce:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring berries, water, and sugar to a simmer in a medium pot over
            medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer until berries have lost their shape and liquid has reduced to
            a thick syrup. Test periodically for level of sweetness, and add
            more sugar if desired.
          </li>
          <li>Citrus zest and/or spices can also be added to taste.</li>
          <li>
            Cool sauce in the refrigerator, unless serving immediately. Drizzle
            over cake and whipped cream topping.
          </li>
        </ol>
