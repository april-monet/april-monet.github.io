        <h2>Method</h2>
        Custard:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Separate egg yolks from whites, into a large mixing bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a medium saucepan, warm cream, vanilla, and salt over medium
            heat. Stir frequently until hot but not boiling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add sugar to the egg yolks and mix well with a whisk. Temper by
            pouring a small amount of the warmed cream mixture into the large
            mixing bowl. Mix well, then gradually add the rest of cream mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strain through a wire mesh sieve/strainer into a large pitcher (such
            as a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the custard into 6 6oz. ramekins until 85% full. Tap ramekins
            on counter several times to remove air bubbles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 2 cups of water to 8-quart Instant Pot/electric pressure cooker,
            and place a steamer rack or bakeware sling inside. Place ramekins
            inside, stacking or cooking in two batches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook on Low Pressure for 13 minutes, and 15 minutes Natural Release.
            Release any remaining pressure with Quick Release.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check that the custard jiggles slightly in the middle. If the whole
            custard moves/is too liquid, continue cooking for another 3 - 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place ramekins on a cooling rack. Once cooled to room temperature,
            cover and refrigerate until ready to add topping. If serving
            immediately, leave at room temperature and proceed to make the
            topping.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Carmelized Sugar:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Spread sugar in an even layer in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Prepare
            a baking sheet with a piece of parchment and place nearby. If
            custard is chilled, remove the ramekins from the refrigerator and
            bring to room temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            On medium heat, heat sugar until it melts. With a rubber spatula or
            silicone spoon, move the sugar gently as needed to incorporate
            unmelted sugar and to keep it from burning. Do not stir vigorously!
          </li>
          <li>
            Once melted, sugar will begin to brown quickly and can burn easily.
            When it is medium to dark brown in color (use your sense of smell to
            decide), remove from heat and pour the carmelized sugar onto
            parchment in a long, thick strip.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the sugar cool until set, and you can the edge off easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Break the caramelized sugar into pieces that fit in your blender.
            Pulse to blend to fine crumbs or powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle a layer of the sugar powder over the top of each custard.
            Place the ramekins on a baking sheet. Move rack to top of oven, and
            place tray with ramekins on it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn on broiler, and leave the the oven door open a crack so you can
            see the sugar melt. Once the sugar has melted and covers the top of
            the custard, remove it from the oven.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let ramekins cool slightly, until sugar has set again in a nice
            crackable layer atop the custard, then serve.
          </li>
        </ol>
